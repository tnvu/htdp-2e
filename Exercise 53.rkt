; Exercise 53. The design recipe for world programs demands that you translate
; information into data and vice versa to ensure a complete understanding of the
; data definition. Itâ€™s best to draw some world scenarios and to represent them
; with data and, conversely, to pick some data examples and to draw pictures
; that match them. Do so for the LR definition, including at least HEIGHT and 0
; as examples.

; An LR (short for launching rocket) is one of:
; - "resting"
; - NonnegativeNumber
; interpretation "resting" represents a grounded rocket
; a number denotes the height of a rocket in flight
; an LR of value HEIGHT means the bottom of the rocket is HEIGHT pixels from the
; top of the canvas
; an LR of value 0 means the bottom of the rocket is at ground level
