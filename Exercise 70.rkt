; Exercise 70. Spell out the laws for these structure type definitions:
; (define-struct centry [name home office cell])
; (define-struct phone [area number])
; Use DrRacketâ€™s stepper to confirm 101 as the value of this expression:
; (phone-area
;  (centry-office
;   (make-centry "Shriram Fisler"
;     (make-phone 207 "363-2421")
;     (make-phone 101 "776-1099")
;     (make-phone 208 "112-9981"))))

(define-struct centry [name home office cell])
; (centry-name (make-centry name home office cell)) ==> name
; (centry-home (make-centry name home office cell)) ==> home
; (centry-office (make-centry name home office cell)) ==> office
; (centry-cell (make-centry name home office cell)) ==> cell

(define-struct phone [area number])
; (phone-area (make-phone 123 "456-7890")) ==> 123
; (phone-number (make-phone 123 "456-7890")) ==> "456-7890"
