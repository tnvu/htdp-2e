; Exercise 83. Design the function render, which consumes an Editor and produces
; an image.
; The purpose of the function is to render the text within an empty scene of
; image pixels. For the cursor, use a image red rectangle and for the strings,
; black text of size 16.
; Develop the image for a sample string in DrRacketâ€™s interactions area. We
; started with this expression:
;   (overlay/align "left" "center"
;                  (text "hello world" 11 "black")
;                  (empty-scene 200 20))
; You may wish to read up on beside, above, and such functions. When you are
; happy with the looks of the image, use the expression as a test and as a guide
; to the design of render.
