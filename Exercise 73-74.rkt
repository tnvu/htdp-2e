; Exercise 73. Design the function posn-up-x, which consumes a Posn p and a
; Number n. It produces a Posn like p with n in the x field.
; A neat observation is that we can define x+ using posn-up-x:
;   (define (x+ p)
;     (posn-up-x p (+ (posn-x p) 3)))
; Note Functions such as posn-up-x are often called updaters or functional
; setters. They are extremely useful when you write large programs.

(define (posn-up-x p n)
  (make-posn n (posn-y p)))

; Exercise 74. Copy all relevant constant and function definitions to DrRacketâ€™s
; definitions area. Add the tests and make sure they pass. Then run the program
; and use the mouse to place the red dot.
