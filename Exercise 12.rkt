; Exercise 12. Define the function cvolume, which accepts the length of a side
; of an equilateral cube and computes its volume. If you have time, consider
; defining csurface, too.
;
; Hint An equilateral cube is a three-dimensional container bounded by six
; squares. You can determine the surface of a cube if you know that the
; squareâ€™s area is its length multiplied by itself. Its volume is the length
; multiplied with the area of one of its squares. (Why?)

(define (cvolume length)
  (* length length length))

(define (csurface length)
  (* 6 (sqr length)))
