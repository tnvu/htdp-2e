; Exercise 1. Add the following definitions for x and y to DrRacketâ€™s
; definitions area:
;   (define x 3)
;   (define y 4)
; Now imagine that x and y are the coordinates of a Cartesian point. Write down
; an expression that computes the distance of this point to the origin, that
; is, a point with the coordinates (0,0).

(define x0 3)
(define y0 4)
(= 5 (sqrt (+ (sqr x0) (sqr y0))))

(define x1 12)
(define y1 5)
(= 13 (sqrt (+ (sqr x1) (sqr y1))))
