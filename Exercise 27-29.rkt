; Exercise 27. Our solution to the sample problem contains several constants in
; the middle of functions. As One Program, Many Definitions already points out,
; it is best to give names to such constants so that future readers understand
; where these numbers come from. Collect all definitions in DrRacketâ€™s
; definitions area and change them so that all magic numbers are refactored into
; constant definitions.

; Modify both programs to reflect this change. When the programs are modified,
; test them again with ticket prices of $3, $4, and $5 and compare the results.
